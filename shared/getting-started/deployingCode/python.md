A nice first project to get started is a simple [Flask][flask-link] web server, which will serve a static page on port `:80`. All the project source code can be found [here on GitHub][simple-server-python-link]. Download a zipped file of the project from [here][simple-server-python-download], and when downloaded unzip the file and navigate to the directory of the project e.g.

```shell
$ cd simple-server-python-master
```

[simple-server-python-link]:{{ $links.githubProjects }}/simple-server-python
[simple-server-python-download]:{{ $links.githubProjects }}/simple-server-python/archive/master.zip
[flask-link]:http://flask.pocoo.org/
