A nice first project to get started is a simple [C++][cpp] hello world program, which will print a `Hello, world!` message to the logs on the dashboard. All the project source code can be found [here on GitHub][balena-cpp-hello-world-link]. Download a zipped file of the project from [here][balena-cpp-hello-world-download], and when downloaded unzip the file and navigate to the directory of the project e.g.

```shell
$ cd balena-cpp-hello-world-master
```
