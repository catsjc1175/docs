A nice first project to get started is a simple [Express.js][expressjs] web server which, will serve a static page on port `:80`. All the project source code can be found [here on GitHub][simple-server-node-link]. Download a zipped file of the project [here][github-download], and when downloaded unzip the file and navigate to the directory of the project e.g.

```shell
$ cd simple-server-node-master
```

[simple-server-node-link]:{{ $links.githubProjects }}/simple-server-node
[github-download]:{{ $links.githubProjects }}/simple-server-node/archive/master.zip
[expressjs]:https://expressjs.com/
